            <div class="text">
                <p>I am a mother, pastor, and entrepreneur with over 20 years experience working in IT.
                    I have always been interested in coding but never took the time to really learn it.  I have been 
                    fortunate to leave the workforce by retiring early and have decided to use this time
                    to gain a new skill set in programming.  
                </p>
                <p> I am excited to see what this next part of my journey will look like and what the 
                    outcome will be. </p>

                <p>In addition to being a part of the Coding Bootcamp, I am urrently becoming a certified John Maxwell
                    trainer.  This is another long term interest of mine, that will afford me the opportunity to 
                    function as a life coach, youth trainer and assist people with DISC training - to better understand 
                    their personality type and how it impacts their performance and interactions with others.
                </p>
                <p> The youth comonent of the certification will create opportuity to assist young people with navigating 
                    issues like peer pressure, self esteem issues and overall becoming better leaders in society. </p>
